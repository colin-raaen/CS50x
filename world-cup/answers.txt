Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

The simulations getting exponentially more accurate proved incorrect.  the results are laregly the same after 10000 simulations

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

I would consider the simulations good enough at 10000 simulations considering the results don't change much, but the run time drastically goes
