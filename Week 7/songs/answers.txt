I would describe the music aura of this persons top 100 as someone who heavily likes hip-hop music as well as American pop music. They tend to like fast-paced music with moderate energy

This aura might be a bad characterization because I'm using the average values instead of the median value, there could be certain songs that are heavily skewing the average calculations
